# Changelog

## 2024

### April 2

#### Feeback inbox

- Provides an inbox for giving feedback which is powered by log matching i.e. that when a new log is received, active tasks are checked to see if their tag selectors match the log. If there is a match, the log is added to the shared inbox. Read more [here](/feedback/log_matching).

### December 22

#### Auto prompt (alpha)

This update adds auto prompting (in alpha stage) to playgrounds. This is our first AI powered feature and applies a taxonomy inspired by SPADE (but rapidly evolving to include more recent work, like the prompting guidance from OpenAI) and an iterative algorithm to generate progressive suggestions (from green: low severity, through red: high severity).

![Auto prompting](/images/docs/autoprompt.png)

Hereâ€™s a [short loom](https://www.loom.com/share/9ac7ab3fbcbf41daad535eaf2a591dfa?sid=34860b1d-20ab-4c6e-a725-bd608db06402) about how to use the feature.
It is currently stateless (so suggestions are only present for active playgrounds) and we will be improving the algorithms over time.

### December 13

#### Metrics

This update adds completion usage and cost metrics to the home page. You can see how many completions you've generated, the tokens you've consumed, and the cost of your completions.

![Metrics](/images/docs/metrics.png)

Users who haven't yet sent any completions to us will be presented with an onboarding screen with more information on how to get started.

##### Major Update to Logs Table

This update makes it easier to navigate and manage large amounts of log data. Here's what's new:

- **Toggle Expanded Logs:** You can now choose to see expanded logs in a wrapped column. This feature allows you to view more detailed information without having to leave the main logs table.

- **Customizable Columns:** We understand that different users have different needs. With this update, you can add or remove columns on the table based on your preferences. This means you only see the data that's relevant to you.

Before:

After:

##### Date range filter

This feature allows you to specify a start and end date, making it convenient to search for past completions.

##### Scroll to the bottom of logs detail pane

You can now quickly scroll to the bottom of your logs detail pane. This feature is especially useful when you're dealing with large log files and want to check the most recent entries.

### November 22

##### Side pane log view

This should make it easier to navigate through many logs while not losing position in the logs table.

Urls for completions have changed, but will still support redirects - from `log10.io/app/<org>/completions/<id>` to `log10.io/app/<org>/completions?id=<id>`.
This makes it possible to deep link filtered views along with the completion, and size of the completion view (compact or wide, managed by the `wide=true` query parameter).
