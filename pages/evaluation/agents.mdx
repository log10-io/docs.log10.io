# Testing agents

Testing agents can be tricky with existing evaluation tools and prompt templates.
One benefits of evaluations being driven by code is that you can test virtually any LLM framework.
In this example, we will test a few agents using [CrewAI](https://crewai.com) and [Serper](https://serper.dev).

Before running the code below, follow the instructions in the [getting started guide](/evaluation).

## Single agent setup

In this example, we will test a single agent counting to a number and verifying the output.
To make things more interesting, we sweep that number from 1 to 3.

```python
import os

import pytest

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process


@pytest.mark.parametrize("count_to", [1, 2, 3])
def test_simple(count_to):
    """
    Single step agent test
    """
    toddler = Agent(
        role="Toddler",
        goal=f"Count to {count_to}",
        backstory="""You are a toddler, learning to count""",
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=True,
    )

    task = Task(
        description=f"""Count to {count_to}""",
        expected_output=f"Counted to {count_to}",
        agent=toddler,
    )

    crew = Crew(
        agents=[toddler],
        tasks=[task],
        verbose=True,
        process=Process.sequential,
    )

    # Get your crew to work!
    result = crew.kickoff()
    assert str(count_to) in str(result)
```

## Multi agent setup

In this example, we will test two agents working together to uncover historical data regarding Elvis Presley's final performance in Las Vegas.
This tends to be a good query, as it requires multiple steps and research to complete and we can verify the output with several facts.

**NOTE** Setup an acccount with SERPER and provide the API key in the environment variable `SERPER_API_KEY` before running the test.

```python
import os

from log10.load import log10
import openai

log10(openai)

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool


def test_multi_agent():
    # Define your agents with roles and goals
    researcher = Agent(
        role="Historical Researcher",
        goal="Uncover historical data regarding Elvis Presley's final performance in Las Vegas",
        backstory="""You are an experienced historian specializing in American cultural events.
        You have a sharp eye for details and a passion for unearthing the truth from historical records.""",
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=False,
        tools=[SerperDevTool()],  # You can use any tools you'd like for research
    )

    journalist = Agent(
        role="Investigative Journalist",
        goal="Write an engaging article on the historical context of Elvis Presley's last Las Vegas performance",
        backstory="""You are a seasoned journalist with a knack for turning historical facts into compelling stories.
        Your writing engages readers by making the past feel relevant and alive.""",
        verbose=True,
        allow_delegation=True,
    )

    # Create tasks for your agents
    task1 = Task(
        description="""Conduct thorough research to determine the date of Elvis Presley's final performance in Las Vegas.
        Cross-reference the performance date with the U.S. president at that time.""",
        expected_output="Detailed timeline of Elvis Presley's last Las Vegas performance, including who was president during that period",
        agent=researcher,
    )

    task2 = Task(
        description="""Using the research provided, write an engaging article exploring the significance of Elvis Presley's final Las Vegas performance.
        Discuss the broader historical and political context, including the presidency at that time.""",
        expected_output="A captivating article of at least 4 paragraphs, weaving together Elvis' performance with the historical era",
        agent=journalist,
    )

    # Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[researcher, journalist],
        tasks=[task1, task2],
        verbose=True,
        process=Process.sequential,
    )

    result = crew.kickoff()
    results_lowered = str(result).lower()
    assert "elvis presley" in results_lowered
    assert "las vegas" in results_lowered
    assert "december" in results_lowered
    assert "1976" in results_lowered
    assert "gerald ford" in results_lowered
```

## Testing agents internal stats

One common issue with agent frameworks is that it can be hard to test the internal state of the agents - it's memory, retrieval etc.
For that, with a programmatic approach, you can just use mocking patterns to test the internal state of the agents.

```python
import os

import pytest

from log10.load import log10
import openai

log10(openai)

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process, LLM
from unittest.mock import patch, call


def test_post_inspection():
    """
    Test the inspection of the LLM call post agent execution
    """
    count_to = 3
    llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini")
    with patch.object(LLM, "call", wraps=llm.call) as mocked_call:
        toddler = Agent(
            role="a toddler",
            goal=f"Count to {count_to}",
            backstory="""You are a toddler, learning to count""",
            verbose=True,
            allow_delegation=True,
            llm=llm,
        )

        task = Task(
            description=f"""Count to {count_to}""",
            expected_output=f"Counted to {count_to}",
            agent=toddler,
        )

        crew = Crew(
            agents=[toddler],
            tasks=[task],
            verbose=True,
            process=Process.sequential,
        )

        # Get your crew to work!
        crew.kickoff()

        # We can inspect the specific calls made to the LLM
        assert "You are a toddler." in mocked_call.call_args_list[0].args[0][0]["content"]
```
