# Computing summary statistics

As LLM are probabilistic models, it is important to compute summary statistics to understand the distribution of the outputs and thus, their reliability when being a part of a bigger system.
For instance, we have users reporting that in some cases, one out of every ten completions is incorrect and cause end users to lose trust in the system.

To address this, we recommend a combination of pytest and pytest-harvest to repeat, and sweep parameters and compute summary statistics on the outputs of the model.

First, install pytest-harvest:

```bash
$ pip install pytest-harvest
```

Now, let us write a small test that generates completions and computes summary statistics on the outputs:

```python
import pytest
import random

@pytest.mark.repeat(10)
def test_simple(results_bag):
    results_bag.result = random.randint(0, 1)

def test_summary(module_results_df):
    assert module_results_df.result.sum() > 0
    assert module_results_df.result.count() == 10
```

This test will run the `test_simple` test 10 times and store the results in a pandas DataFrame.
The `test_summary` test will then check that the sum of the results is greater than 0 and that there are 10 results in total.

This is an extremely flexible and powerful way to compute summary statistics on the outputs of the model.

Here is another example:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

from log10.load import OpenAI

import pytest

@pytest.mark.repeat(3)
@pytest.mark.parametrize("run", ["run1", "run2", "run3"])
def test_simple(run, results_bag):
    client = OpenAI()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "you are a random generator. Generate a random number - and only the number"}]
    )

    results_bag.run = run
    results_bag.result = float(response.choices[0].message.content)
    results_bag.expected = 0


def test_summary(module_results_df):
    f1_scores = module_results_df.groupby("run").apply(
        lambda x: f1_score(x["expected"], x["result"], average="micro")
    )

    print(module_results_df)
    print(f1_scores)
    assert f1_scores.count() == 3
```

This test will run the `test_simple` test 3 times per run, and store the results in a pandas DataFrame.
Then the `test_summary` test will compute the F1 score for each run and check that there are 3 F1 scores in total.

While contrived, once you calibrate scores for your use-case, can be a great way to understand the reliability of your application.
