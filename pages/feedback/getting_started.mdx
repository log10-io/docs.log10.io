# Getting started

To use the Log10 client library, you need to install it from PyPI and configure some environment variables.

## Install Log10

Run the command below to install the Python client from PyPI. We recommend doing this in a virtual environment.

```
pip install log10-io
```


## Create a `.env` template

In your project directory, create a file called `.env` with the following variables. The sections below show how to find the tokens you'll need.

```
LOG10_URL=https://log10.io
LOG10_TOKEN=
LOG10_ORG_ID=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

## Get your `LOG10_TOKEN`

Navigate to **Profile -> Settings -> Create token** to create and manage your Log10 API tokens. 

Copy the token to your `.env` file.

## Get your `LOG10_ORG_ID`

Navigate to **Profile -> Organization** to see your Log10 Organization ID. Copy the value to your `.env` file.

## Get your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

Create an OpenAI token by visiting your OpenAI account at platform.openai.com and navigating to **API Keys -> Create new secret key**.

Create an Anthropic token by visiting your Anthropic account at console.anthropic.com and navigating to **API Keys -> Create Key**.

Copy either or both tokens to your `.env` file.

## Load your tokens to your environment

Once you have all your tokens in a `.env` file, load them into your environment by running `source .env` or manage them using a library like [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv).
