# Log matching

Log10 provides an inbox for giving feedback which is powered by log matching.
This means that when a new log is received, active tasks are checked to see if their tag selectors match the log.
If there is a match, the log is added to the shared inbox.

To start, create a new task with a tag selector. This is a string that is used to match logs.

After creating the task, logs that match the tag selector will be added to the inbox.

And clicking on the log will show the feedback form, and cleared from the inbox once feedback is given.

## Matching semantics

Logs that **include** tags from the tasks's tag selector are considered a match.
For example:

| Log tag   | Task tag selector | Match |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| `foo,bar` | `foo`             | Yes   |
| `foo,bar` | `bar`             | Yes   |
| `foo,bar` | `baz`             | No    |
| `foo,bar` | `foo,bar`         | Yes   |
| `foo,bar` | `foo,baz`         | No    |
